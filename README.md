# fcc-portfolio
This personal portfolio page was made for the freeCodeCamp responsive web design certificate.

It contains original artwork (background image) and links to some of my other personal projects.

The site is largely built with HTML and CSS. Some vanilla JavaScript was added to make the navigation bar hide on scrolling.
